                    Speedcubing (also known as speedsolving, or just cubing) is
                    a sport involving solving a variety of combination puzzles,
                    the most famous being the 3x3x3 puzzle or Rubik's Cube, as
                    quickly as possible. For most puzzles, solving entails
                    performing a series of moves that alter a scrambled puzzle
                    into a state in which every face of the puzzle is a single,
                    solid color. Some puzzles have different requirements to be
                    considered solved, such as the Clock, for which all the
                    dials must be moved into the 12 'o clock position.

                    The standard puzzle sizes are 2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5,
                    6x6x6, and 7x7x7 and the different variations, 3x3x3
                    one-handed, 3x3x3 blindfolded, 4x4x4 blindfolded and 5x5x5
                    blindfolded. There are also different shapes of the famous
                    puzzles, including Pyraminx, Megaminx, Skewb, and Square-1.
                    An individual who competes in speedcubing is known as a
                    speedcuber.

                    The standard 3x3x3 can be solved using a number of methods,
                    not all of which are intended for speedcubing. Although some
                    methods (such as CFOP) employ a layer-by-layer system and
                    algorithms, other significant (though less widely used)
                    methods include corners-first methods and the Roux method.
                    CFOP, Roux, ZZ are considered as the "Big 3" methods, as
                    they are the most popular and can be used to achieve faster
                    times than the others. The "big 3" used to be a "big 4" with
                    the Petrus method as well, but, due to low popularity of
                    people using this method, it had to be taken out from the
                    "big 3". The CFOP method is used by most speedcubers.

                    Since 2003, speedcubing competitions have been held
                    regularly. The World Cube Association (WCA) was formed in
                    2004 to govern all official competitions. For a competition
                    to be official, it must be approved by the WCA and follow
                    the WCA regulations. Included in the regulations is the
                    necessity of having one or more WCA delegate in attendance.
                    A delegate's main role is to ensure all regulations are
                    followed during the competition. Once the competition has
                    finished, the results are uploaded on to the WCA website.
